Let's Play! - Iro 

This is a K-5 online, interactive, and educational game to learn how to sort colors and objects. 
The game essentially allows for a User to pick a color from the provided color options. Once User has chosen a color, different shapes with that color will appear on the screen with extra shapes and different colors. The User will have to detect the colors that match the color originally selected from the game. This will be a time sensitive game with a tracker to keep score. As the player progresses with the score the game will become more and more challenging with each level, adding more shapes and colors to increase the complexity of the game.
